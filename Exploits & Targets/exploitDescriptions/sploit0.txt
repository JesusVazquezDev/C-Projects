First we used gdb to dissassemble main and find what the address of grade F and grade A are. We also checked the ebp of grade F. Then we changed args[1] to 25 characters plus 8 for a buffer overflow. The last 8 characters were: first 4 are the ebp of grade F to prevent a seg fault, the second 4 is the address of A. Of course should be right to left since it is in stack.
