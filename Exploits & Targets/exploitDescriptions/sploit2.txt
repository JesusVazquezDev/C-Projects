Use this file to explain how your sploit2 works.


Similar to sploit1, however we only have 1 byte at our disposal so we need to use the characteristics of EBP and how that affects EIP. 

With the 1 byte at our disposal, we modify the last byte of EBP to specifically fall where our NOPS are. EIP is calculated by incrementing 4 bytes from EBP -- thus, as long as our EBP has an address before. We overflow successfully. 



Input: [NOPS][Shellcode][Last bit of EBP is modified.]
