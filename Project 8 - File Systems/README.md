Currently, this implementation passes 9 out of 10 tests for the autograder. The final test ( Test 10 ) is structured in such a way where half of the inode values are negative. In the time of writing the program, we were unable to determine which way of combating this issue was viable. We attempted to take the absolute values of the inodes, however, this would result in previously saved inodes to be overwritten and would not allow proper creation. Second, we attempted to have a global value that stores the last know valid inode(where the inode value was positive) and another global value to track the amount of invalid inodes were found. This result in more inodes to be assigned ( up to 255 ), however, when searching for the inodes -- the range of inodes is much greater than 255 and thus, we reached an impasse. Perhaps test10 checks whether we are iterating through different inode groups? More testing can be done but given this is finals week, we kinda have to move forward. Unfortunately, our programs fails to find those deleted files to catch the bad guy. Though, in a few days ( after finals ) , we are certain that we would be able to retrieve those delete images and assist in catching the bad guy(s).
