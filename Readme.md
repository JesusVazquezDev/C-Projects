# C/OS Projects

### Most of the projects found in this repo are related to projects I worked on while at university. 

### My most in-depth OS projects involve the XV6 operating system -- a simple, Unix-like, teaching operating system. More info can bem found here: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2022/xv6.html
